# github-fixer-demo
A dummy repo to demonstrate Mobb Fixer for GitHub


To see how Mobb Fixer fixes your code, start a pull request from branch "introduce-new-issue".
Once the PR is created, GitHub CodeQL will start a security scan and detect a new issue.
Mobb Fixer will immediately run and present a fix suggestion on the PR conversation tab.

To commit the suggested code fix, simply click on "Commit fix", and the changes will be commited to the PR.
